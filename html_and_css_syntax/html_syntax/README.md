# HTML Syntax [(View Source)](index.html)

[__<= GO BACK__](../README.md)

Opening and closing syntax of HTML elements:

```
<p>Paragraph content goes here</p>
```

Make text bold using strong tags and italics using em tags:

```
<p><strong>This text should be bold.</strong></p>
<p><em>And this text should have emphasis (italics).</em></p>
```

- The DOCTYPE declares the type of HTML document we want to use.
- The head tag is responsible for any meta and include tags.
- The body hold all the content that the user will see.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
<body>
```
