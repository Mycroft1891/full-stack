# Images with Markup

[__<= GO BACK__](../README.md)

1. [Quiz 1: Make site images more responsive](../units_formats_environments/project/index.html)

Serving images increases the page's response time which takes away from the overall User Experience. In order to optimize images more we can:

- remove text from image and add it as markup
- use CSS effect instead of images
- use CSS background images, colors and gradients
- use unicode characters
- use SVG inline or data uri

## Text on Images

While it might seem like a simple hack to add text to images, the downside is that the text in images are:

- not selectable
- add to the weight
- cannot be searched by search engines
- can't be picked up by screen readers

## Use CSS

CSS is a powerful tool to replace images. It is possible to use colors, gradients and effects to create the illusion of an image with a much faster response time.

## Unicode Characters

Unicode characters are representation of symbols. It is possible to create the illusion of an image using only these characters. Birds, plus signs, hearts, stars, etc.

For a complete list of unicode characters go here:

## Icon Founts

Similar to unicode characters these are vector images that can be imported and used like fonts.

## SVG

This is another great option because unlike images, SVG is indefinitely scalable as well very light weight.
