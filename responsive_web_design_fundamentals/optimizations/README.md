# Optimizations

[__<= GO BACK__](../README.md)

Some of the topics on which we can improve to make our designs more responsive include:

## Responsive Images

We can increase the User experience by rendering different sized images for different screen sizes. This ensures that we always have a crisp image for any device. Further more, we can optimize images for smaller screen cropping them to fit the screen better rather than show a very wide image that doesn't fit.

## Responsive Tables

The are several ways to make tables and their content responsive:

- Hide Columns
- No Tables
- Contained Tables

As there can be a lot of columns in our table, we can remove them and show only the most important ones on smaller screen sizes.
Another approach is to get rid of table all together and use another structure to display the table content.
Yet another approach are contained tables which hold the entire table width but let the user scroll the table to view its entire content.


## Fonts

A big part of making text more readable is to get the font size as well as text length right. Increasing the font size on smaller devices not makes sure that the user can read the text but also that the text is not too long.

## Minor Breakpoints

Major breakpoints allow us to make big changes but minor breakpoints can help us make small adjustments as we progress to major breakpoints. We can increase the font, add padding and also make small changes to they layout.
